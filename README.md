# DSN AI in Every City 2025 Hackathon 

This is my submission for the "Free AI Classes in Every City" Hackathon by Data Science Nigeria (DSN) and Zindi Africa.

# What I Did

- Worked on predicting item-store returns using Python
- Cleaned and prepared real-world data, handled missing values, encoded categories
- Built a Random Forest model to make predictions
- Submitted my results to Zindi (Ranked 76 out of 103 ðŸ˜Š)

#  What I Learned

This was my first machine learning project. I learned how to:
- Work with datasets in pandas
- Train models with scikit-learn
- Build a full ML pipeline from start to finish

#  Files

- `ReturnsPredictionModel.ipynb` â€” my notebook

Thanks to DSN for this opportunity.
